In today’s buzzy day and age, the everyday investor can't afford 20+ hours to understand a company’s financial health and the intricacies of their business model. As a result, popularity and public sentiment are driving the stock market. The “buzz” surrounding a company is slowly becoming more important than the behind-the-scene changes to supply chain or restructuring that affects profit. Take Tesla, whose volatile stock prices can be partially attributed to the eccentricness of Elon Musk. BuzzLine gathers historical data and uses machine learning to determine the correlation between “buzz” and the stock price of a specific company. BuzzLine's analysis will help aid your decision in whether you should buy, sell, or hold.
